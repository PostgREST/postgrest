  The purpose of this worker is to obtain a healthy connection to pg and an up-to-date schema cache(DbStructure).
  This method is meant to be called by multiple times by the same thread, but does nothing if
  the previous invocation has not terminated. In all cases this method does not
  halt the calling thread, the work is preformed in a separate thread.

  Note: 'atomicWriteIORef' is essentially a lazy semaphore that prevents two
  threads from running 'connectionWorker' at the same time.

  Background thread that does the following :
  1. Tries to connect to pg server and will keep trying until success.
  2. Checks if the pg version is supported and if it's not it kills the main
     program.
  3. Obtains the dbStructure.

  Check if a connection from the pool allows access to the PostgreSQL database.
  If not, the pool connections are released and a new connection is tried.
  Releasing the pool is key for rapid recovery. Otherwise, the pool timeout would have to be reached for new healthy connections to be acquired.
  Which might not happen if the server is busy with requests. No idle connection, no pool timeout.

  The connection tries are capped, but if the connection times out no error is thrown, just 'False' is returned.
