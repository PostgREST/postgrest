  The purpose of this worker is to fill the refDbStructure created in 'main'
  with the 'DbStructure' returned from calling 'getDbStructure'. This method
  is meant to be called by multiple times by the same thread, but does nothing if
  the previous invocation has not terminated. In all cases this method does not
  halt the calling thread, the work is preformed in a separate thread.

  Note: 'atomicWriteIORef' is essentially a lazy semaphore that prevents two
  threads from running 'connectionWorker' at the same time.

  Background thread that does the following :
  1. Tries to connect to pg server and will keep trying until success.
  2. Checks if the pg version is supported and if it's not it kills the main
     program.
  3. Obtains the dbStructure.
