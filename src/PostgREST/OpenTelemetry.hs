Module      : PostgREST.OpenTelemetry
Description : OpenTelemetry integration
Maintains the OpenTelemetry Tracer and provides a function to run
PostgREST with it.

Basically, you want to use `withTracer` in your main function, and then
use `getOTelTracer` in your application code to get the tracer and
create spans with `inSpanM`.

At this moment trace spans have to be explicit, by wrapping the code in `inSpanM` calls.
In order produced spans to have correct code locations, all the functions across the call stack up to the
`inSpanM` call must have `HasCallStack` constraint, because
[GHC is never inferring it](https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.8.4/docs/users_guide/exts/callstack.html) for us.
