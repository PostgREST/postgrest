9.0.0
=====

This major version is released with PostgreSQL 14 compatibility and is accompanied with new features and bug fixes. You can look at the detailed changelog and download the pre-compiled binaries on the `GitHub release page <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/releases/tag/v9.0.0>`_.

Features
--------

PostgreSQL 14 compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PostgreSQL 14 Beta 1 tightened its GUC naming scheme making it impossible to use multiple dots (``.``) and dashes (``-``) on custom GUC parameters, this caused our :ref:`old HTTP Context <guc_legacy_names>` to fail across all requests. Thankfully, `@robertsosinski <https://github.com/robertsosinski>`_ got the PostgreSQL team to reconsider allowing multiple dots in the GUC name, allowing us to avoid a major breaking change. You can see the full discussion `here <https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/17045-6a4a9f0d1513f72b%40postgresql.org>`_.

Still, dashes cannot be used on PostgreSQL 14 custom GUC parameters, so we changed our HTTP Context :ref:`to namespace using a mix of dots and JSON <guc_req_headers_cookies_claims>`. On older PostgreSQL versions we still use the settings legacy names. If you wish to use the new JSON GUCs on these versions, set the :ref:`db-use-legacy-gucs` config option to false.

Resource Embedding with Top-level Filtering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Historically, Resource Embedding was always done with a query that included the equivalent of a ``LEFT JOIN``, which meant you could not
exclude any of the top-level resource rows. You can now use :ref:`embedding_top_level_filter` to do the equivalent of an ``INNER JOIN``, thus you can filter the top-level resource rows with any of the available operators.

Partitioned Tables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Partitioned tables now integrate with all the feature set. You can :ref:`embed partitioned tables <embedding_partitioned_tables>`, UPSERT, INSERT(with a correctly generated Location header) and make OPTIONS requests on them. They're also included in the generated OpenAPI.

Functions(RPC)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Functions with a :ref:`single unnamed parameter <s_proc_single_unnamed>` can now be used to POST raw ``bytea``, ``text`` or ``json/jsonb``.

Horizontal Filtering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The ``unknown`` value for three-valued logic can now be used on the ``is`` :ref:`operator <operators>`.

* Escaping double quotes(``"``) in double-quoted surrounded strings is now possible by using backslashes, e.g. ``?col=in.("Double\"Quote")``. Backslashes can be escaped with a preceding backslash, e.g. ``?col=in.("Back\\slash")``. See :ref:`reserved-chars`.

Administration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* A ``Retry-After`` header is now added when PostgREST is doing :ref:`automatic_recovery`.

Error messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* :ref:`embed_disamb` now shows an improved error message that includes relevant hints for clearing out the ambiguous embedding.

Documentation improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added ``curl`` snippets to the :ref:`api` page.

* Added the :ref:`automatic_recovery` section.

* Added the :ref:`nested_embedding` section.

* Added the :ref:`logical_operators` section.

* Added the :ref:`templates` and :ref:`devops` sections to the :doc:`Ecosystem </ecosystem>`.

Bug fixes
---------

* Correct RPC return type handling for RETURNS TABLE with a single column (`#1930 <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/1930>`_).

* Schema Cache query failing with ``standard_conforming_strings = off`` (`#1992 <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/1992>`_).

* OpenAPI missing default values for String types (`#1871 <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/1871>`_).

Breaking changes
----------------

* Dropped support for PostgreSQL 9.5 as it already reached its end-of-life according to `PostgreSQL versioning policy <https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/>`_.

* Partitions of a `partitioned table <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-partitioning.html#DDL-PARTITIONING-DECLARATIVE>`_ are no longer included in the :ref:`schema_cache`. This is so errors are not generated when doing resource embedding on partitioned tables.

* Dropped support for doing :ref:`hint_disamb` using dots instead of exclamation marks, e.g. doing ``select=*,projects.client_id(*)`` instead of ``select=*,projects!client_id(*)``). Using dots was undocumented and deprecated back in `v6.0.2 <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/releases/tag/v6.0.2>`_.
