PostgREST 10.0.0
================

Features
--------

API
~~~

XML/SOAP support for RPC
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

RPC now understands the ``text/xml`` media type, allowing SQL functions to send XML output(``Accept: text/xml``) and receive XML input(``Content-Type: text/xml``). This makes SOAP endpoints possible, check the :ref:`create_soap_endpoint` how-to for more details.

GeoJSON support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

GeoJSON is supported across the board(reads, writes, RPC) with the ``Accept: application/geo+json`` header, this depends on PostGIS from the versions 3.0.0 and up. The :ref:`working with PostGIS section <ww_postgis>` has an example to get you started.

One-to-one relationships
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A :ref:`one-to-one relationship <one-to-one>` is now detected when a table's foreign key is also its primary key or when the foreign key has a ``UNIQUE`` constraint.

Customizable Relationships for Resource Embedding
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using :ref:`computed_relationships`, you can add custom relationships or override automatically detected ones. This makes :ref:`resource_embedding` possible on Foreign Data Wrappers and complex SQL views.

EXPLAIN Execution Plan
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :ref:`EXPLAIN execution plan of a request <explain_plan>` is now obtainable with the ``Accept: application/vnd.pgrst.plan`` header. The result can be in ``text`` or ``json`` formats and is compatible with EXPLAIN vizualizers like `explain.depesz.com <https://explain.depesz.com>`_ or `explain.dalibo.com <https://explain.dalibo.com>`_.

POSIX Regular Expressions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can now use two :ref:`pattern matching <pattern_matching>` operators for `POSIX regular expressions <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-matching.html#FUNCTIONS-POSIX-REGEXP>`_: ``match`` and ``imatch``, equivalent in PostgreSQL to ``~`` and ``~*`` respectively.

Access composite type fields and array elements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:ref:`Accessing fields of a Composite type or elements of an Array type <composite_array_columns>` is now possible with the arrow operators(``->``, ``->>``) in the same way you would access a JSON type fields.

Authorize button for SwaggerUI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can now activate the "Authorize" button in SwaggerUI by enabling the :ref:`openapi-security-active` configuration. Add your JWT token prepending :code:`Bearer` to it and you'll be able to request protected resources.

Improved error messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To increase consistency, all the errors messages are now normalized. The ``hint``, ``details``, ``code`` and ``message`` fields will always be present in the body, each one defaulting to a
``null`` value. In the same way, the :ref:`errors that were raised <raise_error>` with ``SQLSTATE`` now include the ``message`` and ``code`` in the body.

To further clarify the source of an error, we now add a ``PGRST`` prefix to the error code of all the errors that are PostgREST-specific and don't come from the database. These errors have unique codes that identifies them and are documented in the :ref:`pgrst_errors` section.

Administration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Health checks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Admins can now benefit from two :ref:`health check endpoints <health_check>` exposed in a different port than the main app. When activated, the ``live`` and ``ready`` endpoints are available to verify if PostgREST is alive and running or if the database connection and the :ref:`schema cache <schema_cache>` are ready for querying.

Logging users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can now see the :ref:`request database user in the logs <pgrst_logging>`.

Run without configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is now possible to execute PostgREST without specifying any configuration variable. The three that were mandatory on the previous versions, are no longer so.

  - If :ref:`db-uri` is not set, PostgREST will use the `libpq environment variables <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-envars.html>`_ for the database connection.
  - If :ref:`db-schemas` is not set, it will use the database ``public`` schema.
  - If :ref:`db-anon-role` is not set, it will not allow anonymous requests.

Documentation improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added a :doc:`/how-tos/working-with-postgresql-data-types` how-to, which contains explanations and examples on how to work with different PostgreSQL data types such as timestamps, ranges or PostGIS types, among others.

* Added in-database and environment variable settings for each :ref:`configuration variable <config_full_list>`.

* Added the :ref:`file_descriptors` subsection.

* Added a reference page for :doc:`Error documentation </errors>`.

* Moved the :ref:`error_source` and the :ref:`status_codes` sections to the :doc:`errors reference page </errors>`.

* Moved the *Casting type to custom JSON* how-to to the :ref:`casting_range_to_json` subsection.

* Removed direct links for PostgREST versions older than 8.0 from the versions menu.

* Removed the deprecated *Embedding table from another schema* how-to.

* Restructured the :ref:`resource_embedding` section:

  - Added a :ref:`one-to-many` and :ref:`many-to-one` subsections.

  - Renamed the *Embedding through join tables* subsection to :ref:`many-to-many`.

Bug fixes
---------

* Return ``204 No Content`` without ``Content-Type`` for ``PUT`` (`#2058 <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/2058>`_)

* Clarify error for failed schema cache load. (`#2107 <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/2107>`_)

  - From ``Database connection lost. Retrying the connection`` to ``Could not query the database for the schema cache. Retrying.``

* Fix silently ignoring filter on a non-existent embedded resource (`#1771 <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/1771>`_)

* Remove functions, which are not callable due to unnamed arguments, from schema cache and OpenAPI output. (`#2152 <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/2152>`_)

* Fix accessing JSON array fields with ``->`` and ``->>`` in ``?select=`` and ``?order=``. (`#2145 <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/2145>`_)

* Ignore ``max-rows`` on ``POST``, ``PATCH``, ``PUT`` and ``DELETE`` (`#2155 <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/2155>`_)

* Fix inferring a foreign key column as a primary key column on views (`#2254 <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/2254>`_)

* Restrict generated many-to-many relationships (`#2070 <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/2070>`_)

  - Only adds many-to-many relationships when a table has foreign keys to two other tables and these foreign key columns are part of the table's primary key columns.

* Allow casting to types with underscores and numbers (e.g. ``select=oid_array::_int4``) (`#2278 <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/2278>`_)

* Prevent views from breaking one-to-many/many-to-one embeds when using column or foreign key as target (`#2277 <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/2277>`_, `#2238 <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/2238>`_, `#1643 <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/1643>`_)

  - When using a column or foreign key as target for embedding (``/tbl?select=*,col-or-fk(*)``), only tables are now detected and views are not.

  - You can still use a column or an inferred foreign key on a view to embed a table (``/view?select=*,col-or-fk(*)``)

* Increase the ``db-pool-timeout`` to 1 hour to prevent frequent high connection latency (`#2317 <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/2317>`_)

* The search path now correctly identifies schemas with uppercase and special characters in their names (regression) (`#2341 <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/2341>`_)

* "404 Not Found" on nested routes and "405 Method Not Allowed" errors no longer start an empty database transaction (`#2364 <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/2364>`_)

* Fix inaccurate result count when an inner embed was selected after a normal embed in the query string (`#2342 <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/2342>`_)

* ``OPTIONS`` requests no longer start an empty database transaction (`#2376 <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/2376>`_)

* Allow using columns with dollar sign ($) without double quoting in filters and ``select`` (`#2395 <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/2395>`_)

* Fix loop crash error on startup in PostgreSQL 15 beta 3. ``Log: "UNION types \"char\" and text cannot be matched."`` (`#2410 <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/2410>`_)

* Fix race conditions managing database connection helper (`#2397 <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/2397>`_)

* Allow ``limit=0`` in the request query to return an empty array (`#2269 <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/2269>`_)

Breaking changes
----------------

* Return ``204 No Content`` without ``Content-Type`` for RPCs returning ``VOID`` (`#2001 <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/2001>`_)

  - Previously, those RPCs would return ``null`` as a body with ``Content-Type: application/json``.

* ``limit/offset`` now limits the affected rows on ``UPDATE``/``DELETE`` (`#2156 <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/2156>`_)

  - Previously, ``limit``/``offset`` only limited the returned rows but not the actual updated rows

* ``max-rows`` is no longer applied on ``POST``, ``PATCH``, ``PUT`` and ``DELETE`` returned rows (`#2155 <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/2155>`_)

  - This was misleading because the affected rows were not really affected by ``max-rows``, only the returned rows were limited

* Restrict generated many-to-many relationships (`#2070 <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/2070>`_)

  - A primary key that contains the foreign key columns is now needed for generating many-to-many relationships.

* Views now are not detected when embedding using the column or foreign key as target (``/view?select=*,column(*)``) (`#2277 <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/2277>`_)

  - This embedding form was easily made ambiguous whenever a new view was added.

  - For migrating, clients must be updated to the embedding form of ``/view?select=*,other_view!column(*)``.

* Using ``Prefer: return=representation`` no longer returns a ``Location`` header (`#2312 <https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/2312>`_)

Migration Guide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many-to-may relationships
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The way PostgREST infers many-to-many relationships is now restricted. Before this change, a table could work as an intermediate join between two tables just by having foreign keys referencing each one of them. Consider the following:

.. code-block:: postgresql

  CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT
  );

  CREATE TABLE permissions (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT
  );

  CREATE TABLE permission_user (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT REFERENCES users(id),
    permission_id INT REFERENCES permissions(id)
  );

Before, PostgREST could infer a relationship between ``users`` and ``permissions`` through ``permission_user``.

.. tabs::

  .. code-tab:: http

    GET /users?select=permissions(*) HTTP/1.1

  .. code-tab:: bash Curl

    curl "http://localhost:3000/users?select=permissions(*)"

But now this is not allowed. In order for it to work, the intermediate table must also have the foreign keys included in its primary key. So, in this case we need to do the following:

.. code-block:: postgresql

  -- This table has a pk defined already so we drop it first
  alter table permission_user
    drop constraint permission_user_pkey;

  -- Then we add all the foreign keys to the primary key
  alter table permission_user
    add primary key (id, user_id, permission_id);

With this, PostgREST 10 will infer successfully a relationship between ``users`` and ``permissions``.

If you want an alternative to the previous method or need a more customized relationship, you could use :ref:`computed_relationships` to get a similar result.

Embedding views
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using column names or foreign key constraint names as :ref:`embedding targets <target_disamb>` will not detect views anymore. Consider this as an example:

.. code-block:: postgresql

  CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    is_active BOOL
  );

  CREATE TABLE messages (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    body TEXT,
    user_id INT REFERENCES users(id)
  );

  CREATE VIEW active_users AS
    SELECT *
    FROM users
    WHERE is_active;

Previously, the following request returned a ``300 Multiple Choices`` error, because the ``active_users`` view was also detected:

.. tabs::

  .. code-tab:: http

    GET /messages?select=body,user_id(name) HTTP/1.1

  .. code-tab:: bash Curl

    curl "http://localhost:3000/messages?select=body,user_id(name)"

But in this version, this will not fail and will embed the table ``users`` instead. You need to use the view name as target in order to embed it, like this:

.. tabs::

  .. code-tab:: http

    GET /messages?select=body,active_users(name) HTTP/1.1

  .. code-tab:: bash Curl

    curl "http://localhost:3000messages?select=body,active_users(name)"

For other cases, adding a column or foreign key as :ref:`hint <hint_disamb>` may be needed.

You could also use :ref:`computed_relationships` to get a similar result or if you want a more customized relationship.
