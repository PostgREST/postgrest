# Creating a separate libpq package is is discussed in
# https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/61580, but nixpkgs has not moved
# forward, yet.
# This package is passed to postgresql-libpq (haskell) which needs to be
# cross-compiled to the static build and possibly other architectures as
# as well. To reduce the number of dependencies that need to be built with
# it, this derivation focuses on building the client libraries only. No
# server, no tests.
