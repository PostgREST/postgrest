USAGE: $0 COMMAND

Runs the given COMMAND with the PGRST_DB_URI environment variable
set to a temporary database that is ready for running the PostgREST test suite.

You'll need to have the Postgres binaries 'initdb', 'pg_ctl' and 'psql' on your
PATH.

Example:

    $0 stack test

    # Or, for when inside nix-shell
    $0 cabal v2-test

If KEEP_TMP is set (e.g. to "1"), the temporary directory will not be deleted
after exit. The log files in that directory might be useful for debugging
purposes.
